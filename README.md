This is a collection of the data-preprocessing and data-analysis scripts made in relation to my BA thesis in Linguistics at Aarhus University. 
The project investigates which acoustic measures of voice quality best predict the perceptual
experience of vocal affect. 

Here is a brief guide as how to navigate the repository and its contents. 
For the acoustic data, take the following steps IN ORDER:
1. Run the code in the file feature_analysis.R
2. Run the code in the file median_IQR.R
3. Run the code in the file multinom_regression_feature.R

Avoid downloading the feature_data.R directly since the file is too large.

For the perceptual survey data, take the following steps IN ORDER:
1. Run the code in file cleaning_survey_data.R
2. Run the code in file survey_analysis.R


All datasets necessary to run the code in all R files are included in this repository.
