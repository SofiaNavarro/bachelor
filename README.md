This is a collection of the data-preprocessing and data-analysis scripts made in relation to my BA thesis in Linguistics at Aarhus University. 
The project investigates which acoustic measures of voice quality best predict the perceptual
experience of vocal affect. 

Here is a brief guide as how to navigate the repository and its contents.

The project BA_analysis.RProj contains the following relevant files for the acoustic feature analysis:
feature_analysis.R which contains the necessary code to be able to open the feature_data.R file, since this is to large to open as it is.
median_IQR.R contains scripts to reduce the feature dataset by calculating median and interquartile range.
multinom_regression_feature.R contains the full model-making


The file cleaning_survey_data.R shows all the steps taken to clean the survey data. Both the original survey dataset and the cleaned version are included in the repository. 
The file survey_analysis.R contains the scripts used to analyse and visualize the clean survey data.
