These scripts were made during the process of writing my BA project in Linguistics at Aarhus University, Denmark. 
My investigation aims at finding out what acoustic measures of voice quality best predict the perceptual
experience of vocal affect.

I collected 23 recordings from real people, reading a text in four different phonation types: modal (normal), whispery, creaky and harsh. 
Using the COVAREP repository for MatLab I extracted a bunch of acoustic features from those audio files. Those features can be seen
in the file feature_data.R (its quite a large file) and in the formant_data.R

Furthermore, using parts of those recordings, I did a perceptual survey in which 56 subjects were asked to rate 15 samples of the collected recordings
on a 7-pointed Likert scale ranging from "Not [emotion]" to "Very [emotion]".

All of my data along with the analysis and model can be found in this repository, for anyone to double-check my steps.
